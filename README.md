Parasitic bacteria often have heavily reduced genomes. While the mechanism of genome-reduction is well documented, understanding and 
predicting the evolutionary track of rapidly dividing parasitic organisms may prove useful for prevention of disease. This report 
investigates the relationship between protein complexes and their subunits, in the context of protein functionality â€“ it also compares 
the extent of reduction in specific protein functional groups across different organisms. To facilitate these goals, we collect a series 
of bacterial proteomes and tally the number of proteins belonging to each of several functional groups. We compare the proportions of 
functional groups between COGIDs and protein complexes within the same organism via two-sample T-Tests, and proportion of protein of 
specific functions across different organisms via one-way ANOVA tests. We find no significant differences between COGID and protein 
complex proportions in any functional group, with one notable exception. We find significant differences between proportions of most 
functional groups, especially while comparing the least-reduced genomes (E. coli) against the most-reduced genomes (Buchnera).
